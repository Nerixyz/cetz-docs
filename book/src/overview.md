# Overview

CeTZ, ein Typst Zeichenpaket, is a drawing package for [Typst](https://typst.app/). Its API is similar to Processing but with relative coordinates and anchors from Ti*k*Z. You also won't have to worry about accidentally drawing over other content as the canvas will automatically resize. And remember: up is positive!

This book is a work in progress! Please submit issues for parts that don't make sense or need improving :)

The current plan for this book is to hold tutorials and explanations about CeTZ (such as anchors, styling and libraries). A new pdf document will be created in Typst that will act as a function reference. These two items will supersede the current manual pdf.

Until the next CeTZ release, the book will follow the `master` branch of the repository. So what is written here may not be true for the version you are currently working with. After that the book at this url will be updated for each release, essentially how the current Typst docs work. Another book will be hosted at a sub url that will (hopefully) be kept up to date with the `master` branch.

We are also still trying to find a logo for CeTZ so if you have any ideas please let us know through the Typst discord server.
